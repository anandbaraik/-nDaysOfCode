# Classes

Everything in JavScript is an object, with its properties and methods. We create class to create an object. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class.

Once we create a class we can create object from it whenever we want. Creating an object from a class is called class instantiation.

# Defining a classes

```
// syntax
class ClassName {
    //  code goes here
}
```

To define a class in JavaScript we need the keyword class , the name of a class in CamelCase and block code(two curly brackets).

# Class Instantiation

Instantiation class means creating an object from a class. We need the keyword new and we call the name of the class after the word new.

```
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
const person = new Person()
console.log(person) //PersonÂ {}
```

# Class Constructor

The constructor is a built-in function which allows as to create a blueprint for our object. The constructor function starts with a keyword constructor followed by a parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis we pass the properties of the object as parameter. We use the `this` keyword to attach the constructor parameters with the class.

```
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    console.log(this) // Check the output from here
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}

const person = new Person()

console.log(person)
```

- once we create a class we can create many object using the class
- we can pass Default values with constructor

```
class Person {
  constructor(
    firstName = 'A',
    lastName = 'B',
    age = 25,
    country = 'I',
    city = 'O'
  ) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
  }
}

const person1 = new Person() // it will take the default values
const person2 = new Person('P', 'L', 26, 'U', 'G')

console.log(person1)
console.log(person2)
```

# Class methods

The constructor inside a class is a builtin function which allow us to create a blueprint for the object. In a class we can create class methods. Methods are JavaScript functions inside the class. Let us create some class methods.

```
class Person {
  constructor(
    firstName = 'A',
    lastName = 'B',
    age = 25,
    country = 'I',
    city = 'O'
  ) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
}

const person1 = new Person() // it will take the default values
const person2 = new Person('P', 'L', 26, 'U', 'G')

console.log(person1.getFullName())
console.log(person2.getFullName())
```

# Properties with initial value & getter

The get method allow us to access value from the object. We write a get method using keyword `get` followed by a function. Instead of accessing properties directly from the object we use getter to get the value.

```
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('A', 'B', 25, 'I', 'O')
const person2 = new Person('P', 'L', 28, 'U', 'G')

console.log(person1.getScore) // We do not need parenthesis to call a getter method
console.log(person2.getScore)

console.log(person1.getSkills)
console.log(person2.getSkills)
```

# setter

The setter method allow us to modify the value of certain properties. We write a setter method using keyword `set` followed by a function.

```
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
  set setScore(score) {
    this.score += score
  }
  set setSkill(skill) {
    this.skills.push(skill)
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('A', 'B', 25, 'I', 'O')
const person2 = new Person('P', 'L', 26, 'U', 'G')

person1.setScore = 1
person1.setSkill = 'HTML'
person1.setSkill = 'CSS'
person1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

person2.setScore = 1
person2.setSkill = 'Planning'
person2.setSkill = 'Managing'
person2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(person1.score)
console.log(person2.score)

console.log(person1.skills)
console.log(person2.skills)
```

# Static method

The static keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods are not called on instances of the class. Instead, they are called on the class itself. These are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects. An example of static method is Date.now(). The now method is called directly from the class.

```
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
  set setScore(score) {
    this.score += score
  }
  set setSkill(skill) {
    this.skills.push(skill)
  }
  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`

    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. He lives ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
  static favoriteSkill() {
    const skills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Python', 'Node']
    const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * skills.length)
    return skills[index]
  }
  static showDateTime() {
    let now = new Date()
    let year = now.getFullYear()
    let month = now.getMonth() + 1
    let date = now.getDate()
    let hours = now.getHours()
    let minutes = now.getMinutes()
    if (hours < 10) {
      hours = '0' + hours
    }
    if (minutes < 10) {
      minutes = '0' + minutes
    }

    let dateMonthYear = date + '.' + month + '.' + year
    let time = hours + ':' + minutes
    let fullTime = dateMonthYear + ' ' + time
    return fullTime
  }
}

console.log(Person.favoriteSkill())
console.log(Person.showDateTime())
```

# Inheritance

Using inheritance we can access all the properties and the methods of the parent class. This reduces repetition of code. If you remember, we have a Person parent class and we will create children from it. Our children class could be student, teach etc.

```
// syntax
class ChildClassName extends {
 // code goes here
}
```

Let us create a Student child class from Person parent class.

```
class Student extends Person {
  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
}

const student1 = new Student('A', 'B', 'I', 20, 'O')
console.log(student1)
console.log(student1.saySomething())
console.log(student1.getFullName())
console.log(student1.getPersonInfo())
```

# Overriding methods

As you can see, we manage to access all the methods in the Person Class and we used it in the Student child class. We can customize the parent methods, we can add additional properties to a child class. If we want to customize, the methods and if we want to add extra properties, we need to use the constructor function the child class too. Inside the constructor function we call the super() function to access all the properties from the parent class. The Person class didn't have gender but now let us give gender property for the child class, Student. If the same method name used in the child class, the parent method will be overridden.

```
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city, gender) {
    super(firstName, lastName, age, country, city)
    this.gender = gender
  }

  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`

    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''
    let pronoun = this.gender == 'Male' ? 'He' : 'She'

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. ${pronoun} lives in ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
}

const s1 = new Student(
  'P',
  'L',
  20,
  'U',
  'G',
  'Female'
)
const s2 = new Student('A', 'B', 28, 'I', 'G', 'Male')
s1.setScore = 1
s1.setSkill = 'HTML'
s1.setSkill = 'CSS'
s1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

s2.setScore = 1
s2.setSkill = 'Planning'
s2.setSkill = 'Managing'
s2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(s1)

console.log(s1.saySomething())
console.log(s1.getFullName())
console.log(s1.getPersonInfo())

console.log(s2.saySomething())
console.log(s2.getFullName())
console.log(s2.getPersonInfo())
```
